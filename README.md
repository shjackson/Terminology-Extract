# Terminology-Extract
Python Utility for Extracting Key Terminology From Files

This is a simple utility I built to quickly create terminology lists to include in translation projects. The UI -- created in Python with tkinter -- has options for selecting the source file, extracting and exporting key terms from the source file into Excel format.

The current build assumes that the source file is in English. Other languages will be supported in a future version.
